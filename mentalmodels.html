      <h1>Mental Models & Science Communication</h1>
      <p>
        One of my life goals is to build bridges between advanced science and the curious mind.  When I learned physics as a 14‑year‑old,
        the obstacles weren’t just equations — they were visual.  A professor’s chalkboard often contains symbols inaccessible to a
        newcomer.  Yet a well‑chosen diagram can illuminate a concept instantly.  On this page I reflect on two influences who shaped
        my thinking about visual language in science and propose a new way to picture Floquet theory.

      <h2>Kaća Bradonjić: physics through metaphor</h2>
      <p>
        Kaća Bradonjić is an Associate Professor of Physics and Director of Assessment at Hampshire College.  She holds a B.S. in
        philosophy and physics and earned her Ph.D. at Boston University.  Her research sits at the intersection of physics and
        philosophy: she investigates gauge theories of gravity and explores the physical interpretation of conformal and projective
        structures<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.  Beyond the mathematics she uses artistic metaphor — such as drawings and storytelling — to
        probe the relation between physical, intellectual and emotional spaces<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.  Bradonjić’s work reminds me that
        a mental model isn’t just a picture; it’s a lens that connects different ways of knowing.

        Richard Feynman introduced his eponymous diagrams in the late 1940s as a way of turning complicated mathematical integrals into
        simple pictures.  In high‑energy physics these diagrams depict subatomic particles as lines that join and split at vertices,
        encapsulating equations of quantum field theory in strokes of chalk.  Historian David Kaiser notes that by the mid‑20th
        century physicists increasingly used them; they revolutionized theoretical physics and inspired new techniques in solid‑state
        physics<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>.  Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek remarked that his prize‑winning work would have been
        “unthinkable without them”<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>.  To me, Feynman’s great skill was not just in computing amplitudes but in
        breaking down a field dense with equations into pictures that anyone, including my 14‑year‑old self, could tinker with.

      <h2>Dreaming up new visuals</h2>
      <p>
        With these examples in mind, I want to contribute my own simple mental model.  Floquet theory deals with systems driven
        periodically in time.  Mathematically, a time‑periodic Hamiltonian acquires an extra dimension: energy levels repeat every
        “photon” of the driving frequency, forming an infinite ladder of replicas.  It’s like a spiral staircase where each floor is
        identical.  To visualize this, I drew an interactive helix: the vertical axis is the quasienergy, the circles are the repeated
        bands, and a moving dot traces how a state winds through these replicas.  You can play with the animation below.  I hope that
        for a young student it demystifies an abstract theory by presenting it as something tangible and fun.

        A simple helix illustrating Floquet replicas: each circle represents one “Floquet zone” and the moving dot shows how a
        periodically driven system explores these zones.
