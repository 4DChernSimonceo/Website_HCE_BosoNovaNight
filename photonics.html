      <h1>Photonics & Floquet Modes</h1>
      <p>
        Photonics is the science of controlling light.  Instead of wiring electrons around a circuit, you guide photons through engineered
        structures.  This page explores my fascination with photonic cavities, orbital angular momentum (OAM) and the way periodic driving can
        create exotic resonances known as <em>Floquet modes</em>.  The simulations below were performed using the MEEP finite‑difference time‑domain
        (FDTD) package and run on a GPU.

          orbital angular momentum inside the cylindrical cavity.

      <h2>The Floquet cylinder simulation</h2>
      <p>
        The geometry we modelled is simple: a dielectric cylinder of radius ≈2 and height ≈6 (in MEEP units) with relative permittivity
        ε≈12.25 surrounded by a vacuum cladding.  Inside the cavity a ring of tiny sources rotates about the central axis.  Each point source
        emits at the same frequency but with a progressive phase, giving the overall field a helical twist.  Perfectly matched layers (PML)
        surround the computational domain to absorb outgoing radiation and avoid artificial reflections.  By monitoring the <strong>Ez</strong>
        component of the electric field over ~60 simulation units, we observe standing‑wave patterns and interference fringes characteristic
        of Floquet resonances and OAM modes.

          The dielectric cavity boundary (white circle) overlaid with contours of <strong>Ez</strong> (orange).  Concentric and azimuthal
          nodal lines reveal the resonant structure and hint at the higher‑order harmonics excited by the rotating sources.

      <h2>Why this is technically cool</h2>
      <p>
        Periodically driving an optical cavity leads to <em>Floquet engineering</em>, where the natural modes of a system hybridize with the
        driving frequency.  By launching twisted light into the cavity we generated modes carrying orbital angular momentum — these “vortex”
        beams are important in quantum communication and high‑dimensional encoding.  Running the simulation on a GPU using MEEP demonstrates
        that high‑resolution 3D photonic problems can be tackled on modest hardware.  Building the rotating sources required customizing MEEP’s
        source objects and taught me how to translate physical intuition into code.
      </p>

      <h2>From simulation to devices</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond this toy model lies a technological revolution.  Integrated photonic circuits promise to replace energy‑hungry data links with
        optical waveguides.  Researchers describe photonics integrated with electronics as “the transistor for the 21st century.”  One of the
        biggest challenges is packaging: optical fibres have cores around 10 µm across, whereas photonic waveguides on a chip are only
        hundreds of nanometres wide.  Aligning these two components currently requires expensive active alignment under a microscope.
        Engineers at MIT’s FUTUR‑IC project recently developed a new <em>evanescent coupler</em> that provides extra alignment tolerance so
        robots can assemble devices passively; it even allows vertical light transfer between stacked chips<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.
        Simulations like the one above give me a microscopic view of how confined light behaves and motivate my interest in studying
        optoelectronics, an area I’m currently auditing through a university class.
      </p>

      <h2>Interactive cylinder</h2>
      <p>
        To make this picture more tangible I built a simple 3D model of the dielectric cavity and rotating source ring.  You can drag to
        rotate the scene and watch the points spin.  While far from a full solver, it conveys how a rotating pattern injects angular
        momentum into a symmetric cavity.
