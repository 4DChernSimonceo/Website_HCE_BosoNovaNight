      <h1>Biomineralization: Nature’s Crystal Engineering</h1>
      <p>
        Biomineralization is a marvel of evolution — the ability of living organisms to grow crystalline structures with precision far
        beyond our current fabrication tools.  In my research and reading I’m fascinated by how bacteria and algae build nanoscopic
        magnets and glass houses, and how these biological strategies might inspire future micro‑devices.

      <p>
        Some bacteria navigate by sensing Earth’s magnetic field.  They achieve this using <em>magnetosomes</em> — membrane‑bound
        organelles that contain particles of the magnetic mineral magnetite.  Typically 15–20 crystals are arranged in a single
        file chain which behaves like a compass needle, imparting a magnetic moment to the cell<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.  The
        formation of these crystals is tightly controlled: biomineralization produces high‑purity magnetite with species‑specific
        morphologies inside a lipid bilayer<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.  This control over size, shape and alignment is far beyond what we
        currently achieve in the lab, and inspires me to think about nanoscale assembly for future devices.

      <h2>Diatoms and photonic crystals</h2>

      <p>
        Diatoms are single‑celled algae encased in intricately patterned shells of silicon dioxide called frustules.  These lace‑like
        structures are porous and precisely ordered, making them excellent natural photonic crystals.  Researchers study diatoms to
        design low‑power miniature microphones, ultrafast photonic integrated circuits and other microelectromechanical systems<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>.
        A single diatom can be viewed as a pre‑assembled MEMS device: its frustule is optimized for optical, mechanical and biochemical
        performance while minimizing weight<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>.  Such natural engineering motivates my interest in materials science
        and chip manufacturing.
      </p>

      <h2>Inspiration for chip packaging</h2>
      <p>
        Combining photonics and electronics into the same package is widely regarded as the next leap in computing and communication.
        Photonic links can transmit data faster and more efficiently than copper wires, but aligning microscopic waveguides to optical
        fibres is notoriously challenging.  A recent breakthrough from MIT’s FUTUR‑IC project introduced an <em>evanescent coupler</em>
        that relaxes alignment tolerances and even allows vertical light transfer between stacked chips<sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup>.  When I read
        about this I couldn’t help but think of magnetosome chains and diatom frustules — nature’s way of guiding magnetic flux and
        light.  Perhaps future chip packages will borrow from these biomineral architectures, using self‑assembled crystals to align
        and route photons as elegantly as bacteria orient themselves.
